								<h3>Wu Zhen</h3>
								<p>Walking into Wuzhen, there are white walls and tiles, small bridges and flowing water, and everything in front of us comes with a strong flavor of Chinese ink painting. The old houses with carved beams and painted buildings and stone alleys, which is known as the "land of fish and rice, the house of silk", have been the favorite of literati here since ancient times, and they are also the hometown of Mao Dun, a generation of literary giant. The ancient town has a rare water pavilion in the south of the Yangtze River, so it is called "the last pillow water family in China". "I've been here, but I never left", which is the feeling of Wuzhen in Rene Liu. Huang Lei also has this feeling. Because of his love, he and his little friends started the annual drama festival here, which also made Wuzhen a place where countless people dream about it. Some people say that Wuzhen, which has undergone unified transformation now, seems to be too delicate and has lost a historical vicissitudes. However, it can't be denied that the local cultures belonging to the ancient towns of wuyue have been completely preserved.</p>
